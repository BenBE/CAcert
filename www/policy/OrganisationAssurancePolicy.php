<h2> <a name="0"> 0. </a>  Preliminaries </h2>

<p>
This policy describes how Organisation Assurers ("OAs")
conduct Assurances on Organisations.
It fits within the overall web-of-trust
or Assurance process of Cacert.
</p>

<p>
This policy is not a Controlled document, for purposes of
Configuration Control Specification ("CCS").
</p>

<h2> <a name="1"> 1. </a> Purpose </h2>

<p>
Organisations with assured status can issue certificates
directly with their own domains within.

the same as with ordinary users (natural persons)
and as described in the CPS.

<ul><li>
    The organisation named within is identified.

<h2> <a name="3"> 3. </a> Policies </h2> 

<h3> <a name="3.1"> 3.1 </a> Policy </h3> 

<p>
There is one policy being this present document,
and several subsidiary policies.
</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>  This policy authorises the creation of subsidiary policies. </li>
  <li>  This policy is international. </li>
  <li>  Subsidiary policies are implementations of the policy. </li>
  <li>  Organisations are assured under an appropriate subsidiary policy. </li>
</ol>

<h3> <a name="3.2"> 3.2 </a> Subsidiary Policies </h3>

<p>
The nature of the Subsidiary Policies ("SubPols"):
</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
    SubPols are purposed to check the organisation
    under the rules of the jurisdiction that creates the
    organisation.  This does not evidence an intention
    by CAcert to
    enter into the local jurisdiction, nor an intention
    to impose the rules of that jurisdiction over any other
    organisation.
    CAcert assurances are conducted under the jurisdiction
    of CAcert.
  </li><li>
    For OAs,
    SubPol specifies the <i>tests of local knowledge</i>
    including the local organisational forms.
  </li><li>
    For assurances,
    SubPol specifies the <i>local documentation forms</i>
    which are acceptable under this SubPol to meet the
    standard.
  </li><li>
   SubPols are subjected to the normal 
   policy approval process.
</li></ol>

<h3> <a name="">  </a> 3.3  Freedom to Assemble </h3>

<p>
Subsidiary Policies are open, accessible and free to enter. 
</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
    SubPols compete but are compatible.
  </li><li>
    No SubPol is a franchise.
  </li><li>
    Many will be on State or National lines,
    reflecting the legal
    tradition of organisations created
    ("incorporated") by states.
  </li><li>
    However, there is no need for strict national lines;
    it is possible to have 2 SubPols in one country, or one
    covering several countries with the same language
    (e.g., Austria with Germany, England with Wales but not Scotland).
  </li><li>
    There could also be SubPols for special
    organisations, one person organisations,
    UN agencies, churches, etc.
  </li><li>
    Where it is appropriate to use the SubPol
    in another situation (another country?), it
    can be so approved.
    (e.g., Austrian SubPol might be approved for Germany.)
    The SubPol must record this approval.
</li></ol>


<h2> <a name="4"> 4. </a>  Process </h2>

<h3> <a name="4.1"> 4.1 </a>  Standard of Organisation Assurance </h3>
<p>
The essential standard of Organisation Assurance is:
</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
    the organisation exists
  </li><li>
    the organisation name is correct and consistent:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>in official documents specified in SubPol.</li>
      <li>on COAP form.</li>
      <li>in CAcert database.</li>
      <li>form or type of legal entity is consistent</li>
    </ol>
  </li><li>
    signing rights:
    requestor can sign on behalf of the organisation.
  </li><li>
    the organisation has agreed to the terms of the
    Registered User Agreement,
    and is therefore subject to Arbitration.
</li></ol>

<p>
    Acceptable documents to meet above standard
    are stated in the SubPol.
</p>

<h3> <a name="4.2"> 4.2 </a>  COAP </h3>
<p>
The COAP form documents the checks and the resultant
assurance results to meet the standard.
Additional information to be provided on form:
</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
    CAcert account of O-Admin (email address?)
  </li><li>
    location:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>country (MUST).</li>
      <li>city (MUST).</li>
      <li>additional contact information (as required by SubPol).</li>
    </ol>
  </li><li>
    administrator account names (1 or more)
  </li><li>
    domain name(s)
  </li><li>
    Agreement with registered user agreement.
    Statement and initials box for organsation
    and also for OA.
  </li><li>
    Date of completion of Assurance.
    Records should be maintained for 7 years from
    this date.
</li></ol>

<p>
The COAP should be in English.  Where translations
are provided, they should be matched to the English,
and indication provided that the English is the
ruling language (due to Arbitration requirements).
</p>

<h3> <a name="4.3"> 4.3 </a> Jurisdiction </h3>

<p>
Organisation Assurances are carried out by
CAcert Inc under its Arbitration jurisdiction.
Actions carried out by OAs are under this regime.
</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
    The organisation has agreed to the terms of the
    Registered User Agreement,
  </li><li>
    The organisation, the Organisation Assurers, CAcert and
    other related parties are bound into CAcert's jurisdiction
    and dispute resolution.
  </li><li>
    The OA is responsible for ensuring that the
    organisation reads, understands, intends and
    agrees to the registered user agreement.
    This OA responsibility should be recorded on COAP
    (statement and initials box).
</li></ol>

<h2> <a name="5"> 5. </a> Exceptions </h2>


<ol type="a"><li>
    <b> Conflicts of Interest.</b>
    An OA must not assure an organisation in which
    there is a close or direct relationship by, e.g.,
    employment, family, financial interests.
    Other conflicts of interest must be disclosed.
  </li><li>
    <b> Trusted Third Parties.</b>
    TTPs are not generally approved to be part of
    organisation assurance,
    but may be approved by subsidiary policies according
    to local needs.
  </li><li>
    <b>Exceptional Organisations.</b>
    (e.g., Vatican, International Space Station, United Nations)
    can be dealt with as a single-organisation
    SubPol.
    The OA creates the checks, documents them,
    and subjects them to to normal policy approval.
  </li><li>
    <b>DBA.</b>
    Alternative names for organisations
    (DBA, "doing business as")
    can be added as long as they are proven independently.
    E.g., registration as DBA or holding of registered trade mark.
    This means that the anglo law tradition of unregistered DBAs
    is not accepted without further proof.
</li></ol>
