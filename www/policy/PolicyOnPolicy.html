<h1> Policy&nbsp;on&nbsp;Policy </h1>


<h2 id="s0"> 0. Preliminaries </h2>
<p>
    Policy on Policy adopts the IETF model of
    'rough consensus' to create CAcert documents
    within the open <span class="strike">[policy] mail list forum.</span> <span class="change">CAcert Policy Group <a href="https://lists.cacert.org/wws/info/cacert-policy"> mail list forum</a></span>.
</p>


<h2 id="s1"> 1. Scope and Purpose </h2>

<p id="s1.1">
1.1
This policy documents and controls the process by which
CAcert creates and promulgates policies.
</p>

<p id="s1.2">
1.2
The policy covers itself.
The policy replaces prior ones.
For Audit purposes,
the policy is part of the Configuration-Control Specification
("CCS", <a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/CA_review_A.html#A1">DRC_A.1</a>)
and also documents part of the CCS.
</p>

<p id="s1.3">
1.3
The policies so created are generally binding on
<span class="strike">CAcert, registered users and related parties</span>
<span class="change">CAcert Inc., members under CAcert Community Agreement
(CCA => COD9) and other related parties under other agreements</span>.
</p>

<p id="s1.4">
1.4
The Policy Officer manages all policies
and the policy group.
The policy group is formed on the open mailing list
known as <span class="strike">[cacert-policy]</span> <span class="change">CAcert Policy Group</span>, and is to be open to all
Community Members of CAcert.
</p>

<h2 id="s2"> 2. Basic Model </h2>

<p id="s2.1">
2.1
The basic concept was drawn from the IETF model.
</p>

<p id="s2.2">
2.2
Policies are documented.
Documents start as <i>Work-In-Progress</i>, move through to
<i>DRAFT</i> and finalise in <i>POLICY</i> status.
</p>

<p id="s2.3">
2.3
Decisions are taken by "Rough Consensus."
A vote may be called to clarify.
</p>

<p id="s2.4">
2.4
Documents should include a minimum of information
in a standardised format managed by the Documentation Officer:
the Title,
short name,
Document Status,
date the Status was reached,
Editor,
date / time of the last edit,
Abstract.
</p>

<h2> 3. Work-In-Progress </h2>

<p>
3.1
An Editor is identified.
This person is responsible for
drafting the document, following the consensus of the policy group.
</p>

<p>
3.2
The Policy Officer resolves minor disputes and keeps order.
</p>

<p>
3.3
The mail list of the policy group
is used as the primary debating
forum. A sub-group may be formed,
but decision-taking
should be visible on the main group.
</p>

<p>
3.4
Documents start with the status of
"Work-In-Progress" or WIP for short.
</p>


<h2> 4. DRAFT status </h2>

<p>
4.1
On completion, a document moves to DRAFT status.
</p>

<p>
4.2
A DRAFT is a policy-in-effect for the Community and is
to be distributed and treated as such.
</p>

<p>
4.3
As far as the Community is concerned, the DRAFT is policy.
Challenges and concerns can be addressed to the policy group,
and policy group discussions on a DRAFT
may be presented in Dispute Resolution.
</p>

<p>
4.4
Revisions of DRAFTs
must be treated as decisions on the policy group.
</p>

<p>
4.5
The period of the DRAFT status is announced widely,
which should be at least a month and no longer than a year.
</p>

<p>
4.6
During the period of DRAFT,
CAcert Inc. retains a veto over
policies that effect the running of CAcert Inc.
</p>


<h2> 5. POLICY status </h2>
<p>
5.1
After DRAFT period has elapsed with no revision beyond
minor and editorial changes,
there should be a decision
to move the document from
DRAFT to POLICY status.
</p>

<p>
5.2
Once POLICY, the Community may only challenge the document
in Dispute Resolution.
</p>

<p>
5.3
Policy group may propose changes to a POLICY document
in order to update it.  When changes move to DRAFT status,
they may be included in the POLICY document,
but must be clearly indicated within as DRAFT not POLICY.
</p>

<h2> 6. Open Process </h2>

<p>
6.1
All policy discussions and documents should be open
processes.  There should be a fair chance for
the Community
to have their views heard.
Rough Consensus is the working metric.
</p>

<p>
6.2
Contributions to
formally controlled documents such as Policies
are transferred fully to CAcert Inc.
Copyrights
and similar intellectual property rights
required to incorporate the Contribution
are either transferred to CAcert Inc, or,
are issued and contributed under free,
open, non-restrictive,
irrevocable, exclusive,
and clear licence to CAcert Inc.
In all cases, CAcert Inc licenses the
contributions back to the community
under an open licence.
</p>

<p>
6.3
Contributors declare any conflicts of interest.
</p>

<p>
6.4
Policies should be issued under free, open,
non-restrictive,
irrevocable, non-exclusive,
and clear licence by CAcert, Inc.
</p>

<p>
6.5
Mailing lists should be archived,
and important meetings should be minuted.
</p>

<h2> 7. Disputes. </h2>

<p>
7.1
Any questions not resolved by these rules
may be voted on in the policy group, or
may be dealt with in Dispute Resolution.
</p>

<p>
7.2
The Policy Officer may decide a tight vote in a minor matter only.
Failure of Rough Consensus may be declared by
dissenting members.
</p>

<p>
7.3
Matters unresolved refer back
to further group discussion.
</p>

<p>
7.4
The external avenue for disputes is to file a dispute
according to CAcert's
<a href="http://www.cacert.org/policy/DisputeResolutionPolicy.html">
Dispute Resolution Policy</a>
DRP => COD7.
