CAcert Assurer Training Event Sdney
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Much has happened during the past 3 years. The old way of 
orally-transmitted procedures has now gone, and our rules have been cast 
into formal policies. New procedures (e.g. the Assurer Challenge) and 
obligations (e.g. in the CAcert Community Agreement) have been approved. 
The Assurer Training Events bring all this to you, the Community:

- How does the CCA protect you and every CAcert Community Member?
- Can you recall the 5 parts of the Assurance Statement?
- Can you tick off the security features of the Australian passport?
- What do you when something goes drastically wrong?

Answers to these and many other questions are given at the Assurer 
Training Events (ATEs).

ATE-Sydney takes place on:
- Wednesday, March 24th from 6:00pm till 9:30pm
- Sydney University School of IT, Building J12
   Ground Floor Lecture Room, room 123.
