CAcert Assurer Training Event London
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Much has happened during the past year. A list of up till now
mostly "orally transmitted" rules have been cast in policies.
New procedures (e.g. the Assurer Challenge) and obligations
(e.g. in the CAcert Community Agreement) have been decided. The
Assurer Training Events try to bring all this informations to "the
people":

- To what, does the CCA protect every CAcert-Community-Member and as such also you?
- Can you recount the 5 statements of the "Purpose of Assurance"?
- Can you at least recount 10 security marks of your own passport/Identity card?
  
Answers to these and following questions are given at the Assurer Training Events (ATE's).

The following events are planned:
