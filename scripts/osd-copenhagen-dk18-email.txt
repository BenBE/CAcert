Dear Assurers,

The call for participation deadline is Jan 20th 2010

As we have another event at the same time (Cebit 2010), we are in need
of assistance from additional local assurers who can make this thing happen.

We are looking for assurers who are available to organize
CAcert's participation at Open Source Days 2010.

As organizer for this event you get all assistance you'll need
from the events team leader.

If you are interested in helping please respond

before the deadline.

Thanks for your assistance in advance.
