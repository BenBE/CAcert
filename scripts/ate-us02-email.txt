Dear Member,
There is going to be a CAcert Assurance Event next week in San Diego.  It will be held at the USENIX'09 Technical Conference at the Town & Country Hotel.  Here is an opportunity to get the points you still need for your CAcert account, and learn more about what CAcert has to offer. 

This will be more than just an Assurance event, it will also be a "Report to the Community", Assurance Training Event (ATE), and Assurance Event.  It is also an opportunity for us to hear from you.

Please email me gstark@cacert.org if you decide to attend and can help out.  Not to worry, if you are not registered for the conference itself, the Birds of a Feather (BoF) is open to all.  It will be an opportunity to meet others in the CAcert community. PGTP/GPG signing is being done.

Please remember to bring your filled out forms, and two government issued photo ID's, and if you are doing PGTP/GPG signing, have those printed out too.

Regards,
Greg Stark
