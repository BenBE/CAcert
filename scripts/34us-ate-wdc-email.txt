Dear Member of the CAcert Community,

Just a quick final reminder that we will hold an ATE - Assurer Training Event - in Chantilly, VA this coming Saturday, 12:00.

It's a lunch time event in a private room, so come hungry to the Eggspectations Restaurant in Westone Plaza.

Assurers and prospective Assurers are the intended audience.  We also invite those who just want the chance to get assured.  (Note that old Tverify / Thawte points are gone, and if you haven't done our fabulously entertaining *Assurer Challenge* you are not an Assurer anymore.)

Bring your ID documents and some CAP forms!

- Best regards from the Event Team!

ATE-WDC takes place at:
*  Saturday, June 18th, 2011
*  Eggspectations Restaurant, Westone Plaza, Chantilly VA.
*  12:00 - 16:30
