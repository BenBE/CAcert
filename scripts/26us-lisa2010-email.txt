Dear CAcert Assurer,

If you are attending the LISA'2010 conference in San Jose, CA, or if you live in the area, please consider attending the BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions on Tuesday evening, 11/09/2010.  I will be leading two seperate hour long BoF sessions.  Both will be held in the Blossom Hill room of the San Jose Convention Center.  The first is a GPG key signing event at 8:00pm.  The second is a CAcert BoF, where we hope to educate and enroll some new assurers.

I presented these same two BoF sessions at the LISA'09 conference in Baltimore.  In order to bring any new assurers up to the 100 point level, we will need a few other assurers to help them earn their first trust points.  I will also encourage them to them assurer each other on paper.  They can then go on-line after the event and once they complete the Assurer Challenge, they start earning experience points.

I can't pull off a successful CAcert event without a few other assurers.  I am qualified to give out 35 points.  I have one other assurer who has already contacted me and he is good for up to 15 points (and looking to earn more experience points himself).  There were a few assurers who showed up to help last year, but I did not know in advance who was coming.  If you can help, please reply to this e-mail letting me know you can attend and how many points you are qualified to assign.

For more details on the events, please visit the following web pages or contact Ken.  I don't really need help with the GPG key signing BoF, but you are certainly welcome to join us.
