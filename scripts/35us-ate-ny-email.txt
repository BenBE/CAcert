Dear Member of the CAcert Community,

We have a possibility to run an Assurer Training Event in New York in the period June 20th to 26.  One of our co-auditor-presenters is in Washington DC for the ATE on the 18th, and is willing to make the trip.

 -     Can you help?  Can you attend?

If you are interested in attending, please reply to this email with "I want to attend an ATE in New York, I prefer XXXXX dates."

*If you can help then please contact us*.  We need some combination of these things:

    * on-ground contact person
    * venue good for everyone to get to, about 3 hours access
    * accomodation
