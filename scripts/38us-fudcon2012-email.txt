Hi,

I'm a Fedora developer and sysadmin (and a CAcert Assurer), and am going to be attending the Fedora Users and Developers Conference which will be held at Virginia Tech from January 13 - 15, 2012.

We have a GPG/PGP keysigning party planned, and I'm interested in getting some people together to offer CAcert assurances.  This is especially important since CAcert will be removing all points formerly obtained by Thawte Point Transfer very soon.

Would you be interested in helping with a CAcert assurance event at FUDCon?  I'm not sure of the date yet, but it would be somewhere between the 13th and 15th.

Please contact me at either nb@fedoraproject.org or nb@cacert.org if you might be interested in helping with this.

Nick
