CAcert Assurer Training Event -- Washington DC / Chantilly
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Dear Member of the CAcert Community,

Much has happened during recent years. The old way of orally-transmitted 
procedures has now gone, and our rules have been cast into formal 
policies. New procedures (e.g. the Assurer Challenge) and obligations 
(e.g. in the CAcert Community Agreement) have been approved.

The Assurer Training Events bring all this to you, the Assurer, and the 
Community:

- What do you have to add onto the CAP form if you assure minors ?
- What are the 2 essential CCA points you have to present an Assuree ?
- Who can access the Member's privacy information?

Answers to these and many other questions typically faced by Assurers 
are given at the Assurer Training Events (ATEs).  Bring your ID for 
assurances.  Especially note that Tverify/Thawte people need to boost up 
their Assurance Points.

ATE-WDC takes place at:
*  Saturday, June 18th, 2011
*  Eggspectations Restaurant, Westone Plaza, Chantilly VA.
*  12:00 - 16:30

For Registration please reply: 'I will attend ATE-Washington'

Don't forget your ID!

We are looking forward to hearing from you.


- Best regards from the Event Team!
